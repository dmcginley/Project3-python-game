## Technologies Used
### The Code
* **Python3**

### Libraries used
- **Py_somthing** https://www.........


### Graphic/UX Design
* **Figma, Gimp, & Inkscape.**

## Design Decisions

I decided to create a website that would take the user on a journey for uploading a CSV file to be able to view it as a chart, rather than just having a chart and expecting that they would automatically know what to do with it.


## Features


## Color Choices


## Responsiveness



## Accessibility


## Consistency

## Testing

*All tested in Incognito mode.*



### Validator Testing
- **HTML**
<https://validator.w3.org/>

- **CSS**
<https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>

	![CSS validator testing image](readme-images/css-valid.png)
- **JS**
<https://jshint.com/>

	![image of jshint results](readme-images/js-valid.png)

The 3 "unused variables" refer to the functions that are not called inside the JS file, they are callbacks from the HTML page.

### Manual Testing
*...and how I went about it.*



Checked each time that it switched between the bar and line chart smoothly.

Checked each button went to the proper location.

### Responsive Testing

 300px, to laptop 1920px, and to the desktop at 2560px (QHD).

On larger screens, I made sure that the chart did get too large as after a certain size it became clumsy to use.

## Error Handling

- I implemented it to show an error when you would upload an image, as before that PapaParse would still parse the image into an array, so it wouldn't catch the error,

- I also set a limit of two columns so you couldn't upload a blank file.

- I changed the "hitRadius" so that the chat (especially the line chart) is easier to hover on, I found this from reading the [Chartjs docs.](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html)

- [jshint](https://jshint.com/) was showing a error so I reformated the clearData() function.

## Deployment
Deployed using GitHub Pages. <https://github.com/dmcginley/project2-chart-my-data/settings/pages>

I went to my  Repository (project2-chart-my-data), and under the "Settings" tab went down to the "Pages" section on the left menu.
There I could easily deploy my site. 

Once everything was deployed I checked everything was working ok. I checked that the files would upload ok. I checked response times and refresh time, the links, and the buttons.


Chart Data can be found here - https://dmcginley.github.io/project2-chart-my-data (same link as above)

## Image optimization for the web

For all the images I edited them in [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) changing the resolution when required. I'd pass the images through
Tinypng and then put them in the image folder.
- [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)

- [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) - used for generating the set of images for the tab in the browser.
